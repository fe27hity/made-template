## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Impact of Climate-Related Events on Public Support for Climate Action in the United States

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. Are individuals living in areas experiencing greater financial and physical damage from climate-related events more likely to support climate change countermeasures?

2. Do individuals residing in regions with higher frequencies of climate-related weather events (e.g., storms, floods) tend to be more supportive of climate change countermeasures?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Climate change is a global issue, and large emitters like the U.S. play a critical role in addressing it. However, political division complicates action, as major parties have opposing views on climate change. The median voterâ€™s stance varies significantly, and personal motivations remain unclear. I aim to explore whether individuals affected by climate-related events (e.g., tornadoes, storms, floods) are more likely to prioritize climate change as a personal concern.
